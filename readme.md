# Pi-Day
## Happy Pi-Day!!!!!!!!!!!!  
In the honor of Pi Day I have created visualisation which shows an approximation of Pi based upon the ratio of the area of a circle and an area of a square.  
The idea is as follows:  
![circler](http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/qq/database/qq.09.06/s/lori1.1.gif "CircleR")  
If the area of this circle and it's radius are donated as A<sub>c</sub> and r respectively. The formula for the area of the circle is  
![AreaOfCircle](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_%7Bc%7D%3D%5Cpi%20r%5E2 "area of a circle")  
If the area of the square is denoted by A<sub>s</sub> then the formula would be  
![AreaOfSquare](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_%7Bs%7D%3D4r%5E2 "Area of a square")  
So the ratio of A<sub>s</sub> and A<sub>c</sub>, we will call R is  
![RatioOfCircleAandSquarA](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BA_%7Bc%7D%7D%7BA_%7Bs%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%20r%5E2%7D%7B4r%5E2%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B4%7D "Ratio of areas")  
We can then rearrange to get the formula for the pi  
![pi](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cpi%20%3D%204R "PI equation")  

So to make an approximation of Pi I have drawn a circle within a square. I will place random points in the square and by working out the ratio of points within the circle compared to within a square we will try to approcimate PI.

Anyone who wants to imoprove on this please do, send me a pull request, I would love to see any more creative ideas.
